** Overview
- Don't need to make an entire protocol. You only need to use the gbn as an example and the current emulator
- Need to figure out the differences between Go-back-N and Selective Repeat then repurpose the code to Selective Repeat

** Differences:
- Window size: 
    GBN -> senderWinSz = N ; receiverWinSz = 1 
    SR -> senderWinSz = N ; receiverWinSz = N 

- Receiver 
    GBN: Discard out-of-order packets
    SR: Accept and buffer out-of-order packets 

- Retransmission: 
    GBN: Retransmit from first lost frame
    SR: Retransmit lost frame only 

- Buffer requirement at receiver: 
    GBN: low -> cause only need to buffer in order frames
    SR: high -> Need buffer for out-of-order frames 

- ACK 
    GBN: Cumulative ACK -> This means that ACK 8 will also act as ACK for 5,6,7 even if the lower ACKs have yet to be received
    SR: Individual ACK for each received frames 

- Error handling:
    GBN: Retransmit multiple frames on errors (or timeouts)
    SR: Only retransmit error (or timeout) frames 

- Window sliding:
    GBN: Window moves forward when Cumulative ACK is received. So when ACK 8 is received, window will move forward despite not 
    having ACK 7 
    SR: Move forward per ACK -> This means that the window will stop sliding with frame 2 at the beginning of the window if ACK 2 
    has yet to be received
