* A few tasks needed to finish a1
- Able to send cached data to client (This might be working already
    but not properly cause cache storing is unfinished)
- Create proper request line for origin server
    + Just some speculation but we could do
    + originServerRequest = "GET / HTTP/1.1"
    + originServerRequestHeader = "Host: http.badssl.com"

- Code to receive response from origin server 
    + Right now we could just do
    + originResponse = originServerSocket.recv()
    + Could print out response to ensure that it's correct
- Direct request to client (terminal)
    + connSocket.send() would do 
    + Printout sent response for debugging
- Note about send() and recv()
    + Dunno how Python handles it but when coding in Java
    I have to make a loop to process individual lines with send()
    and recv() as far as I remember. So keep this in mind as you move
    forward

-> Left this here to keep track of things for any possible tasks
that is unfinished 

== NEW ORDER FROM THE MINISTRY OF TRUTH ==
* Remaining tasks
    - Load from cache is failing not storing cache 
        + Could be quite the quick fix 
        + Was not a quick fix at all, dunno why but part of the code 
        that is responsible for loading the cache is not executing
        + The behavior is kinda weird, the "Test send" message actually
        works meaning that send() from the part that load cache works but
        the response is quickly overwritten by the main response
