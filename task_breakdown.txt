* A few tasks needed to finish a1
- Able to send cached data to client (This might be working already
    but not properly cause cache storing is unfinished)
- Create proper request line for origin server
    + Just some speculation but we could do
    + originServerRequest = "GET / HTTP/1.1"
    + originServerRequestHeader = "Host: http.badssl.com"

- Code to receive response from origin server 
    + Right now we could just do
    + originResponse = originServerSocket.recv()
    + Could print out response to ensure that it's correct
- Direct request to client (terminal)
    + connSocket.send() would do 
    + Printout sent response for debugging
- Note about send() and recv()
    + Dunno how Python handles it but when coding in Java
    I have to make a loop to process individual lines with send()
    and recv() as far as I remember. So keep this in mind as you move
    forward
