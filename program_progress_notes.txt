** Theorizing
- One good thing about this is that it seems to be really close to many
previous project from prior courses where you just build some algo

- Figuring out what to include inside DistanceVector() func
because the program will be expected to include DV implementation
there
    + Since it will print out table of each implementation, we could
    do output inside each function.
    + Easiest thing could do with params: put user input there.
    + Could do something like 
    DistanceVector(<action> , [input1 , input2 , distance]);
    for now. Could change it later when needed
    + Could attempt to implement the table inside the function as well
    + Could use main to take care of input but DV() should have debug mode

- But how about each node, what type would each of them be?
    + Each node will need to contain: link_table, node_name
    + Iteration will manage by the function to ensure all node sync
    + Each table will be a matrix that contains: [col1]->destination;
    [col2] -> neighbor_to _destination; [col3]->distance_to_destination

- Linking each router.
    + Each router will be a struct that is a [router]
    + Each [router] struct wil consists of: router_name , [link_table]
    + Each [link_table] will consists of: destination , next_hop , distance_to_destination

** Progression
- Program has been made to receive user input and continually prompt if 
the keyword "END" is not inputted. 
- Now need to process inputs for link table
- The program can now process user input for router links and put them in the link_table[]
for the corresponding router_list[] element
    + However, will also need to finish the findEmptyLink() function to find the next empty
    link in the link_table[]. Currently using index 0 to test and debug

- Now need to do the distanceVector() function 
+ Program will go through all routers 
+ Look into the link_table
+ Then it will go to each of its own neighbor's link_table (if dest and next_hop is the same string)
+ Compare the both link_tables (except for links where it is self->self) or distance is 0)
+ Then update accordingly
+ Then go through the whole thing again if there is an update

- Currently, need to input all the remaining dest to a router as inf even if they are not neighbors
+ Might need to keep an array of string to input in as other dest later
+ But if this is the case, then links won't be added after START but only updated

- So the DistanceVector would work like so 
+ go through all possible routers 
+ Each router will check for all possible connections 
+ Each router will then go through each enighbor to ask for the neighbor's link_table
+ If (router->dest < (router->neighbor + neighbor->dest)) then update router->dest cost and next_hop
+ If any update is done then restart the loop
+ Also if found any distance is -1 then it should be treated as infinity

- Could make another function to find the neighbor and conenction since we don't append them in order
+ Will also assume that user only inputs single character as inputs because returning string from
function is a lot of work
