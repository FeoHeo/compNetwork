** Progress log
- Figuring out what to include inside DistanceVector() func
because the program will be expected to include DV implementation
there
    + Since it will print out table of each implementation, we could
    do output inside each function.
    + Easiest thing could do with params: put user input there.
    + Could do something like 
    DistanceVector(<action> , [input1 , input2 , distance]);
    for now. Could change it later when needed
    + Could attempt to implement the table inside the function as well

- But how about each node, what type would each of them be?
    + Each node will need to contain: link_table, node_name
    + Iteration will manage by the function to ensure all node sync
    + Each table will be a matrix that contains: [col1]->destination;
    [col2] -> neighbor_to _destination; [col3]->distance_to_destination
