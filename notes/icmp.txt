** Construct of a ICMP packet
	- Type: 1 byte
	- Code: 1 byte
	- Checksum and Header: 2 byte
	- IP datagram that causing error: 8 byte

** Traceroute
	- Works by send a set (noramally 3) UDP datagrams to dest
		+ 1st set has TTL = 1; 2nd set has TTL = 2;...
	- Datagram in nth set arrives at nth router
		+ Router discards datagram and sends source ICMP message (like a ping response)
		+ IP address of router where TTL expired is source IP address
		of datagram containing this ICMP msg (receiving packet has the
		same IP of sender and receiver compared to sending but flipped)
	- When ICMP msg arrives at source: record RTTs
