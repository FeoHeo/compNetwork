[Note]
	- Checkout the first lecture of week 5 as it has information on how to do the second assignment
	- For TCP if you get ACK-5 then any packet before will also get ACK. Even if ACK-4 and ACK-3 is
not yet received
	- If the ACK flag is set to 1 then the packet is an acknoledgement
	- The Seq number of client will increase overtime and ACK number of server will increase overtime
		+ The reason why Seq number in the example incease by 1 becasue a char is 1 byte in data 
therefore, Seq increase by 1 everytime it is sent

	- The presented packet headers in a TCP packet will then further be pushed down to IP layer to
put a few extra headers on there to help packet reach destination
